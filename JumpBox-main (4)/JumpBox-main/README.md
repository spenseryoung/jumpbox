# Team Protocol
Version Control Process with Github  
• main "current" version of the game is on master branch  
• All edits are made on personal branches, then merged back in with pull requests.  
• Another team ate must approve your pull request to avoid oversights  
• Try to keep any pull request functioning - ie. runs to some extent.  
• Conflicts - if the solution seems trivial, combine the conflicts personally AND TEST before  continuing the pull  
 • if non-trivial, contact team member who created the conflicting code and discuss solution."  
 • ALL resolved conflicts should be mentioned in pull request notes for ease of problem solving  
  
Content creation/sourcing Pipeline and Organization  
• highest level of organization is levels - scenes  
• each level should have its own folder for level-specific media  
• shared elements (character and objective sprites, ie.) kept in designated shared folder  
• extra caution when modifying this folder.  
• All assets should be added with reference to their source in "sources" document  
ie.  
  _• Character sprites  
   • a.png, b.png - 1.com - 2/22/22  
   • c.png, d.png - 2.com - 1/08/22  
  • Level 1  
   • background 1. png - 3.com - 0/00/00  
   • floor. ping - group member A in X - 1/11/11_  
• To keep progress moving, using temporary assets while "real" ones are being made is ok where it makes sense (ie. using a solid color block as a platform) but files should be denoted with "X_temp"  
• ie "bg1_temp.png" to be later replaced with "bg1.png"
